# saferout_nyc
map safer walking and biking routes

This app combines two API's. The NYPD collisions API and Google's JavaScript Directions API
to offer users safer biking and walking routes in NYC.

SAFERout can simply run in a browser so long as it can access the API endpoints that it needs to hit.
